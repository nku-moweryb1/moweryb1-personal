        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Brian, an IT professional. I enjoy finding solutions and trying out the newest technology.  I hope this website will give a nice introduction to myself.</p><br>
		<p>I'm a born and raised Cincinnatian.  I grew up on the east side of town in Anderson Township and went to McNick High School.</p>  
		<p>After finishing high school I decided to focus on a career.  Eventually I decided that a college degree would help me go further in my profession.</p>
		<p>I'm now working full time while trying to finish up my Bachelors degree.</p>
